# **Elevator Control Software Model**

When it comes to optimizing elevator performance in diverse environments such as hotels, office buildings, and residential complexes, the right elevator control system is paramount. At our team, we specialize in crafting tailored elevator control software solutions to ensure an efficient and seamless experience for users.

These are WSRPM models shows how we works for 100 floors hostel.

## **World Assumptions:**

- When a person would like to change floors, they will call an elevator and wait for one to arrive.
- If an elevator is full the person/people that called the elevator will not enter and instead call another elevator after the full elevator leaves.
- only 5 elevators for a building with 100 floors

## **User Requirements**

- Trying to figure out how to send people to their floors in the least amount of trips.
- User-friendly interface for select floor.
- Run elevators safely and smoothly.

## Specifications

- When a person would like to call an elevator there will be an up button or down button depending on where their desired floor is.
- When the elevator is called the nearest elevator that is going in the direction will stop at the floor it is called at.
- The person/people will then enter the elevator and then set their destination.
- The elevator will then stop at any floors that have elevators called and are going in the same direction to pick up more people.

## Program

- Making this software using the Java and its frameworks.
- **Elevator door control system**: control elevator door switch.
- **Elevator operating system**: controls the rise and fall of the elevator.
- **Floor selection system:** controls the elevator to stop at the floor.
- **Elevator fault system**: emergency stop the elevator and call the manager when a fault occurs.
- **Passenger Call System**: Built-in telephone allows passengers to communicate with the service desk.
- **Monitoring system**: monitor the internal conditions of the elevator.

## Machine

- Receiver to get inputs for elevator calls.
